# CSharp-Spec
This is my specialization project on gameplay programming in C# in Unity 3D.
The goal for this project was to create a game in Unity and learn C#. I spent 1 month on learning C# syntax and a month and a half programing the game. The game itself is graybox prototype of the 1995 Sega game X-men Clone Wars. It was my favorite game when I was a kid so I decided to learn programming by making this game.
